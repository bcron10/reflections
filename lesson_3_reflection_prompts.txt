When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you need to share your work with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If files you are working on have been changed in the remote repository you would want to manually review the changes made

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is just for Github it takes a clone of a repository just on Github and links back credit to the orginal project. A clone is a copy of a repository for your local machine. A branch is a different path in a repository. A fork is used when you want to work on a someones github project. A clone is where you want to start a fresh copy of a project on a different machine or by a different user. A branch is where you want to work on a particular sub project (eg an issue or bug) in a project and then merge it back into the main branch when you are finished

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to see the current status of the remote repository and gives you an idea of what changes have been made to the repository

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Email changes between users. Easier to get started but not scalable across multiple users
